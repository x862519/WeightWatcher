All 3 questions are written in Java. They are under src\Question3. Directory file for question1 is under \new\Dictionary.txt.

Question 1:
  a. doesFileExist(String path) returns true if file is found. Otherwise, return false.
  b. readDictionary(String path) returns data inside dictionary file. Using Map<String,List<String>> to store it. It can also handle if word appears more than once.
  
Question 2:
  a. I put all verificaton in main section. 
  b. I tested it with FireFox.
  c. Close brower in the end.

Question 3:
  a. The requirement is vague. It does not say the range of random numbers. It does not say if repeat numbers is allowed or not. But it should not affect the idea of my implementation too much.
  b. I set the range between 1 to 5000
  c. Repeat numbers is allowed. It doesn't matter if we try to get the nth smallest number.
  d. If n<0 or >500(invalid input), I just return -1.
